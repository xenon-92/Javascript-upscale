# Callback in JS

> Javascript is essentially single threaded. Events are not only the asynchronous part of the javascript. There are  callbacks, promise , async etc.
> Any long running function has to be asynchronous for the UI to remain responsive.
> If the long running program runs on the main thread then it eventually freezes the UI, which is a worst thing to happen to it
